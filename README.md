## Problem Statement

Customer churn represents one of the most critical challenges facing subscription-based businesses. The ability to predict which customers are likely to discontinue their subscriptions enables companies to implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately reducing revenue loss and improving customer lifetime value.

This project addresses the churn prediction challenge for an e-commerce platform operating on a subscription model, utilizing user activity data to build accurate predictive models. The implementation handles several real-world complexities including class imbalance, data quality issues, and the need for continuous model monitoring and retraining.

## Data Processing and Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of user activity logs containing 286,500 records across 19 features. The dataset captures various aspects of user behavior including session activity, music listening patterns, social interactions, and subscription events.

#### Key Dataset Characteristics

| Attribute | Description | Data Type | Missing Values |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| `ts` | Timestamp of user activity | datetime64[ns] | 0 |
| `userId` | Unique user identifier | float64 | 8,346 (2.9%) |
| `sessionId` | Session identifier | int64 | 0 |
| `page` | Type of user action/page visited | object | 0 |
| `auth` | Authentication status | object | 0 |
| `method` | HTTP method | object | 0 |
| `status` | HTTP status code | int64 | 0 |
| `level` | Subscription level (free/paid) | object | 0 |
| `itemInSession` | Item number in session | int64 | 0 |
| `location` | User location | object | Various |
| `userAgent` | Browser/device information | object | Various |
| `lastName` | User's last name | object | Various |
| `firstName` | User's first name | object | Various |
| `registration` | Registration timestamp | datetime64[ns] | 0 |
| `gender` | User gender | object | Various |
| `artist` | Artist name (for music events) | object | Various |
| `song` | Song title (for music events) | object | Various |
| `length` | Song duration in seconds | float64 | Various |

### Data Quality Assessment

Our comprehensive data quality assessment revealed several key insights that informed our preprocessing strategy:

#### Missing Data Patterns

The analysis identified systematic missing data patterns that required careful handling. Missing `userId` values (8,346 records) were determined to represent unauthenticated sessions or data collection issues and were removed from the analysis as they cannot be linked to specific user behavior patterns.

For music-related fields (`artist`, `song`, `length`), missing values were interpreted as non-music events and were filled with appropriate defaults ('Unknown' for categorical fields, 0 for numerical fields). This approach preserves the distinction between music and non-music activities while maintaining data integrity.

User demographic information (`location`, `userAgent`, `lastName`, `firstName`, `gender`) contained various missing patterns. These were filled with 'Unknown' to create a separate category for missing information, allowing the model to learn patterns associated with users who did not provide complete profile information.

#### Churn Definition and Label Creation

A critical aspect of the data processing involved defining churn accurately and preventing data leakage. We defined churn based on the presence of 'Cancellation Confirmation' events in a user's activity history. This approach provides a clear, observable definition of churn that can be reliably identified from the available data.

The churn label creation process involved identifying all unique users who had at least one 'Cancellation Confirmation' event during the observation period. This binary classification approach (churned vs. not churned) aligns with typical business requirements for churn prediction models.

#### Temporal Considerations and Data Leakage Prevention

To prevent data leakage, all features were derived from historical user activity up to the latest timestamp in the dataset. The feature engineering process ensures that no future information is used to predict churn outcomes. Time-based features such as 'time_since_last_activity' and 'days_since_registration' inherently capture temporal aspects of user behavior without introducing leakage.

### Class Imbalance Analysis

The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance, with 44,864 churn events out of 278,154 total records (approximately 16.1% churn rate). This imbalance is typical in churn prediction scenarios and was addressed through our model selection and evaluation strategy.

We employed stratified sampling in our cross-validation approach to ensure that both training and testing sets maintain representative distributions of churned and non-churned users. This approach provides more reliable performance estimates and ensures the model learns to handle the imbalanced nature of the problem effectively.

## Feature Engineering

### Methodology and Rationale

Our feature engineering strategy focuses on creating user-level aggregations that capture meaningful patterns in customer behavior. The approach transforms event-level data into user-level features that represent engagement patterns, behavioral preferences, and subscription health indicators.

#### Engagement Metrics

We developed several key engagement metrics that quantify user interaction with the platform:

**Session-Based Features**: Total sessions and average session duration provide insights into user engagement frequency and depth. Users with fewer sessions or shorter session durations may indicate declining interest and higher churn risk.

**Content Consumption Features**: Total songs played and average songs per session capture music consumption patterns. These metrics help identify users whose listening behavior may be declining, potentially indicating dissatisfaction or reduced platform value.

#### Behavioral Preference Indicators

User feedback and social interaction features provide insights into user satisfaction and platform engagement:

**Feedback Metrics**: Thumbs up and thumbs down counts, along with their ratios relative to total songs played, indicate user satisfaction levels. Users with higher negative feedback ratios or lower overall engagement may be at higher risk of churning.

**Social Engagement Features**: Add to playlist and add friend counts capture social aspects of platform usage. Users who actively engage with social features may have stronger platform attachment and lower churn propensity.

#### Temporal and Subscription Features

Time-based features capture user lifecycle and engagement recency:

**Recency Indicators**: Time since last activity provides crucial information about user engagement recency. Users with longer periods of inactivity are typically at higher risk of churn.

**Tenure Features**: Days since registration captures user lifecycle stage. The relationship between tenure and churn can be complex, with both very new users (who haven't established usage patterns) and very old users (who may be experiencing fatigue) potentially at higher risk.

**Subscription Health**: The binary paid user indicator captures subscription tier, which often correlates strongly with churn behavior. Paid users typically have lower churn rates due to their financial investment in the platform.

### Feature Engineering Implementation

The feature engineering process aggregates event-level data to the user level, creating a comprehensive profile of each user's behavior patterns. The implementation handles edge cases such as division by zero in ratio calculations and ensures all features are properly normalized and scaled.

#### Mathematical Formulations

Key feature calculations include:

- **Thumbs Up Ratio**: `thumbs_up_count / total_songs_played`
- **Thumbs Down Ratio**: `thumbs_down_count / total_songs_played`
- **Average Songs per Session**: `total_songs_played / total_sessions`
- **Time Since Last Activity**: `max_timestamp - user_last_activity_timestamp` (in days)
- **Days Since Registration**: `max_timestamp - user_registration_timestamp` (in days)

The implementation includes robust handling of edge cases, replacing infinite values and NaN results with appropriate defaults (typically 0) to ensure model stability.

### Feature Selection and Validation

The final feature set consists of 13 carefully selected features that capture different aspects of user behavior:

1. `total_sessions` - Engagement frequency
2. `avg_session_duration` - Engagement depth
3. `total_songs_played` - Content consumption volume
4. `avg_songs_per_session` - Content consumption intensity
5. `thumbs_up_count` - Positive feedback volume
6. `thumbs_down_count` - Negative feedback volume
7. `add_playlist_count` - Content curation behavior
8. `add_friend_count` - Social engagement
9. `time_since_last_activity` - Engagement recency
10. `days_since_registration` - User tenure
11. `thumbs_up_ratio` - Positive feedback rate
12. `thumbs_down_ratio` - Negative feedback rate
13. `is_paid_user` - Subscription tier

This feature set provides comprehensive coverage of user behavior patterns while maintaining interpretability and avoiding redundancy.


## Model Training and Evaluation

### Algorithm Selection and Justification

We selected XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) as our primary algorithm based on several key factors that make it particularly well-suited for churn prediction tasks:

#### Technical Advantages

**Handling Mixed Data Types**: XGBoost excels at processing datasets with mixed numerical and categorical features without requiring extensive preprocessing. Our dataset contains both continuous variables (session duration, song counts) and discrete indicators (subscription status, feedback counts), making XGBoost an ideal choice.

**Robustness to Outliers**: User behavior data often contains outliers (users with extremely high or low activity levels). XGBoost's tree-based approach provides natural robustness to these outliers without requiring extensive data cleaning or transformation.

**Feature Importance Interpretation**: The algorithm provides built-in feature importance scores, enabling business stakeholders to understand which user behaviors are most predictive of churn. This interpretability is crucial for developing targeted retention strategies.

**Class Imbalance Handling**: XGBoost handles imbalanced datasets effectively through its objective function and can be further tuned with class weights if needed. Our dataset's 16.1% churn rate represents a moderate imbalance that XGBoost manages well without additional balancing techniques.

#### Performance Characteristics

**Scalability**: XGBoost is designed for efficiency and can handle large datasets with minimal memory overhead. This scalability is important for production deployment where the model may need to process thousands of predictions per second.

**Gradient Boosting Framework**: The ensemble approach combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictor, often achieving superior performance compared to single algorithms. This is particularly valuable in churn prediction where subtle patterns in user behavior need to be captured.

### Model Architecture and Pipeline

Our implementation employs a comprehensive preprocessing and modeling pipeline that ensures reproducible and robust results:

#### Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline utilizes scikit-learn's `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` classes to create a standardized workflow:

```python
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("num", StandardScaler(), numerical_features)
    ]
)

model_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("classifier", XGBClassifier(
        objective="binary:logistic",
        eval_metric="auc",
        random_state=42
    ))
])
```

**Feature Scaling**: We apply `StandardScaler` to all numerical features to ensure that features with different scales (e.g., session counts vs. duration in seconds) contribute equally to the model. This normalization is particularly important for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales.

**Pipeline Integration**: The pipeline approach ensures that preprocessing steps are applied consistently during both training and prediction phases, preventing data leakage and ensuring reproducible results.

### Cross-Validation Strategy

We implemented a robust evaluation methodology using stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance estimates:

#### Stratified K-Fold Implementation

```python
kf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
```

**Stratification Benefits**: Stratified sampling ensures that each fold maintains the same proportion of churned and non-churned users as the overall dataset. This approach is crucial for imbalanced datasets as it prevents individual folds from having significantly different class distributions.

**Cross-Validation Advantages**: The 5-fold approach provides more robust performance estimates compared to a single train-test split. By training and evaluating the model on different data subsets, we obtain a better understanding of model stability and generalization capability.

**Reproducibility**: The fixed random seed ensures that results are reproducible across different runs, which is essential for model development and debugging.

### Performance Metrics and Results

Our evaluation employs a comprehensive set of metrics specifically chosen for binary classification with class imbalance:

#### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Accuracy** | 88.89% | Overall correctness across all predictions |
| **Precision** | 80.00% | Accuracy of positive (churn) predictions |
| **Recall** | 69.23% | Coverage of actual churn cases |
| **F1-Score** | 74.23% | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| **ROC AUC** | 91.10% | Overall discriminative ability |
| **PR AUC** | 76.26% | Performance on imbalanced dataset |

#### Detailed Performance Analysis

**ROC AUC (91.10%)**: The high ROC AUC indicates excellent discriminative ability. The model can effectively distinguish between users who will churn and those who will not across different probability thresholds. This metric is particularly valuable for ranking users by churn risk.

**Precision-Recall AUC (76.26%)**: This metric is more informative than ROC AUC for imbalanced datasets. The strong PR AUC indicates that the model maintains good performance even when focusing specifically on the minority class (churners).

**Precision (80.00%)**: High precision means that when the model predicts a user will churn, it is correct 80% of the time. This is crucial for retention campaigns where false positives result in wasted resources on users who wouldn't have churned anyway.

**Recall (69.23%)**: The recall indicates that the model identifies approximately 69% of users who actually churn. While there's room for improvement, this level of coverage provides substantial value for retention efforts.

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix provides detailed insights into model performance:

```
                Predicted
Actual    No Churn  Churn
No Churn    164      9     (TN: 164, FP: 9)
Churn        16     36     (FN: 16, TP: 36)
```

#### Error Analysis and Business Implications

**True Negatives (164)**: Users correctly identified as unlikely to churn. These users can be maintained with standard engagement strategies.

**True Positives (36)**: Users correctly identified as likely to churn. These represent successful predictions where targeted retention efforts can be most effective.

**False Positives (9)**: Users predicted to churn who actually don't. These represent wasted resources in retention campaigns but have relatively low business impact compared to false negatives.

**False Negatives (16)**: Users who actually churn but were not identified by the model. These represent the highest business impact as they result in lost revenue without any retention attempt.

#### Business Impact Assessment

**Cost of False Positives**: Unnecessary retention efforts for 9 users who wouldn't have churned. If retention campaigns cost $50 per user, this represents $450 in wasted spend per 225 users evaluated.

**Cost of False Negatives**: Lost revenue from 16 unidentified churners. If average customer lifetime value is $200, this represents $3,200 in lost revenue per 225 users evaluated.

**Return on Investment**: The model's ability to correctly identify 36 out of 52 actual churners (69.23% recall) enables targeted retention efforts that can significantly outweigh the costs of false positives.

### Model Limitations and Areas for Improvement

#### Current Limitations

**Feature Coverage**: The current feature set focuses primarily on engagement and behavioral metrics. Additional features such as customer service interactions, payment history, or external factors could potentially improve performance.

**Temporal Modeling**: The current approach treats user behavior as static snapshots. Incorporating time-series modeling or recurrent neural networks could capture temporal patterns in user behavior more effectively.

**Threshold Optimization**: The model uses default probability thresholds for classification. Business-specific threshold optimization based on the relative costs of false positives vs. false negatives could improve practical performance.

#### Potential Enhancements

**Ensemble Methods**: Combining XGBoost with other algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) could potentially improve robustness and performance.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: The current implementation uses default XGBoost parameters. Systematic hyperparameter optimization using techniques like Bayesian optimization could yield performance improvements.

**Feature Engineering**: Advanced feature engineering techniques such as polynomial features, interaction terms, or domain-specific ratios could capture more complex patterns in user behavior.


## Automated Retraining System

### System Architecture and Design Philosophy

The automated retraining system represents a critical component of production machine learning systems, designed to maintain model performance as data patterns evolve over time. Our implementation provides a conceptual framework with basic scripting that demonstrates key principles while acknowledging the complexity required for full production deployment.

#### Core Components

**Data Drift Detection**: Monitors changes in feature distributions that could indicate shifts in user behavior patterns or data collection processes.

**Performance Monitoring**: Tracks model performance metrics over time to identify degradation that might necessitate retraining.

**Automated Retraining Pipeline**: Orchestrates the complete retraining process from data ingestion through model deployment.

**Model Versioning and Registry**: Manages different model versions and facilitates rollback capabilities when needed.

### Data Drift Detection Implementation

Our data drift detection system employs statistical methods to identify significant changes in feature distributions:

#### Conceptual Framework

```python
def check_for_data_drift(new_data_path, historical_data_path):
    new_df = pd.read_csv(new_data_path)
    historical_df = pd.read_csv(historical_data_path)
    
    # Compare key feature distributions
    new_total_sessions_mean = new_df["total_sessions"].mean()
    historical_total_sessions_mean = historical_df["total_sessions"].mean()
    
    # Threshold-based drift detection
    if abs(new_total_sessions_mean - historical_total_sessions_mean) / historical_total_sessions_mean > 0.1:
        return True  # Significant drift detected
    return False
```

#### Advanced Drift Detection Methods

While our current implementation uses simple statistical comparisons, production systems would typically employ more sophisticated methods:

**Population Stability Index (PSI)**: Measures the shift in population distribution between training and scoring datasets. PSI values above 0.2 typically indicate significant drift requiring model retraining.

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Statistical test that compares the distributions of continuous features between historical and new data. P-values below 0.05 indicate significant distributional differences.

**Jensen-Shannon Divergence**: Measures the similarity between probability distributions, providing a symmetric metric for comparing feature distributions across time periods.

#### Implementation Considerations

**Feature Selection for Monitoring**: Not all features require equal monitoring attention. Key behavioral features (session counts, engagement metrics) should be prioritized over demographic features that change slowly.

**Threshold Calibration**: Drift detection thresholds must be calibrated based on business requirements and historical data patterns. Too sensitive thresholds lead to unnecessary retraining, while too lenient thresholds miss important changes.

**Multi-Feature Monitoring**: Production systems should monitor multiple features simultaneously and aggregate drift signals to make retraining decisions.

### Performance Degradation Monitoring

The performance monitoring component tracks model effectiveness over time and triggers retraining when performance drops below acceptable levels:

#### Monitoring Strategy

```python
def check_for_performance_degradation(new_model_path, historical_metrics_path, current_featured_data_path):
    # Load current model and evaluate on recent data
    new_model = joblib.load(new_model_path)
    current_df = pd.read_csv(current_featured_data_path)
    
    # Calculate current performance
    current_roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_current, y_proba_current)
    
    # Compare against historical performance
    if current_roc_auc < historical_roc_auc * 0.95:  # 5% degradation threshold
        return True  # Retraining recommended
    return False
```

#### Key Performance Indicators

**ROC AUC Monitoring**: Primary metric for overall model discriminative ability. Significant drops indicate reduced ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners.

**Precision-Recall Metrics**: Particularly important for imbalanced datasets. Monitoring both precision and recall ensures the model maintains effectiveness for both positive and negative classes.

**Business Metrics**: Conversion rates of retention campaigns, customer lifetime value improvements, and cost-effectiveness of interventions provide business-relevant performance indicators.

#### Monitoring Implementation

**Holdout Validation Sets**: Maintain dedicated validation sets that are not used for training to provide unbiased performance estimates over time.

**Rolling Window Analysis**: Evaluate model performance on rolling time windows to identify trends and seasonal patterns in performance degradation.

**A/B Testing Framework**: Compare new model versions against existing models in production to ensure improvements before full deployment.

### Retraining Pipeline Architecture

   - Monitor performance in production environment
   - Maintain rollback capabilities

#### Scheduling and Triggering

**Scheduled Retraining**: Regular retraining intervals (weekly, monthly) ensure models stay current with evolving user behavior patterns.

**Event-Driven Retraining**: Triggered by significant data drift, performance degradation, or business events (product launches, seasonal changes).

**Hybrid Approach**: Combination of scheduled and event-driven retraining provides comprehensive coverage while optimizing computational resources.

### Model Registry and Versioning

Effective model management requires comprehensive versioning and registry capabilities:

#### Version Management

**Model Artifacts**: Store complete model pipelines including preprocessing steps, trained models, and metadata.

**Performance Tracking**: Maintain historical performance metrics for each model version to enable comparison and rollback decisions.

**Deployment History**: Track which model versions were deployed when and their performance in production.

#### MLflow Integration

Our implementation integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry:

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

# Log model training experiment
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_params(model_params)
    mlflow.log_metrics(performance_metrics)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "churn_prediction_model")
```

**Experiment Tracking**: Automatically log model parameters, metrics, and artifacts for each training run.

### Challenges and Limitations

#### Current Implementation Limitations

**Simplified Drift Detection**: The current statistical comparison approach provides basic drift detection but lacks the sophistication required for production systems.

**Manual Intervention Required**: While the framework is automated, deployment and rollback decisions still require human oversight.

**Limited Monitoring Scope**: Current monitoring focuses on statistical metrics rather than business outcomes and user experience impacts.

#### Production Implementation Challenges

**Data Pipeline Complexity**: Real-world data pipelines involve complex ETL processes, data quality validation, and schema evolution management.

**Model Serving Infrastructure**: Production deployment requires sophisticated serving infrastructure with load balancing, caching, and failover capabilities.
